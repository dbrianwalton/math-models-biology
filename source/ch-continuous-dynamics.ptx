  <title>Continuous Dynamics</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Our exploration of population models have thus far considered discrete time.
      This is particularly useful for populations that have distinct cycles of development.
      For example, many plants and animals reproduce in annual cycles.
      In these cases, it makes sense to consider how the state of the system changes from a specific point in one season to the same point in the next season.
      Alternatively, we may want to model how a population changes over fixed increments of time between measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we explore the possibility of modeling populations or other biologically relevant systems where change occurs continuously in time.
      The motivation for these models is that changes to a population or other relevant state variables can occur at essentially any time.
      As these variables change, the conditions that influence the underlying rate of change has now updated and additional future change is actually occurring at a new rate.
      Discrete time models are most appropriate where we can visualize all change occuring at once (or at least can be precisely predicted from the initial state).
      A continuous time model will be most appropriate when our understanding of the rate of change needs to update immediately as the conditions change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where discrete time models were developed using the framework of <term>projection models</term>, continuous time models will be developed using <term>differential equation models</term>.
      The basic idea that we will be developing is that the rate of change of a state variable, which is defined mathematically as a <term>derivative</term> of that state variable, can be modeled to be related to the state of the system.
      When each state variable has a well-defined equation for its rate of change, we have a system of differential equations.
      For well formed systems of equations, a computational tool can give us estimates for continuous functions for each state variable that would satisfy all of these equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter will focus on the process of developing the systems of equations.
      These equations will share remarkable similarity to the models we developed for discrete time models, differing primarily in terms of interpretation.
      We will develop skills in implementing numerical computation for the models.
      Where projection models had fixed points, our differential equations can have equilibria solutions.
      We will then develop an understanding of stability for these equilibria.
