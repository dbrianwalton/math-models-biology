    <title>Differential Equations for Two Interacting Variables</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            A single differential equation allows us to model a single state variable.
            Just as we could create a system of projection equations when dealing with a population involving multiple state variables, we can similarly create systems of differential equations for multiple state variables.
            In this section, we will focus on systems of differential equations involving two state variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> represent two state variables that interact, affecting each other's rate of change.
            That is, the rate of change for <m>X</m> will be some function of both <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> (and possibly time).
            The same will be true for <m>Y</m> but with a different function.
            That is, there are two functions <m>f_1(t, X, Y)</m> and <m>f_2(t, X,Y)</m> so that
            <md>
                <mrow> X' \amp = f_1(t, X, Y),</mrow>
                <mrow> Y' \amp = f_2(t, X, Y).</mrow>
            </md>
            The system is <term>autonomous</term> or <term>time independent</term> if the rate functions do not depend on time, in which case we write
            <md>
                <mrow> X' \amp = f_1(X, Y),</mrow>
                <mrow> Y' \amp = f_2(X, Y).</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section, we will discuss some strategies for understanding how to generalize the ideas of the phase line, slope fields, and equilibria autonomous systems of differential equations involving two state variables.
            A phase line is used to understand solution behavior for a single variable.
            A <term>phase plane</term> will be the generalization to explore the dynamics for two variables.
            A slope field is a graphical representation showing the rate of change for a single variable with respect to time.
            A <term>vector field</term> allows us to generalize this to visualize relative rates of change for two variables simultaneously.
            Finally, equilibria will exist when both rate functions are equal to zero simultaneously.
            We will look for these equilibria by describing where individual rate functions equal zero<mdash/>called nullclines<mdash/>and find their points of intersection.

        <title>The Phase Plane and Vector Fields</title>

        <p>
            When we find solutions to the system of differential equations,
            our two state variables each will be functions of time.
            Each of them will have their own graph involving points <m>(t, X(t))</m> or <m>(t,Y(t))</m>.
            The idea of the phase plane is to consider the state variables as forming points in the plane, <m>(X,Y)</m>.
            At each instant of time <m>t</m>, the value of <m>X(t)</m> will determine the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point while the value <m>Y(t)</m> will determine the <m>y</m>-coordinate.
            As time passes, the values of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> change, and the corresponding state as a point will move around in the phase plane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the functions <m>X(t) = \cos(t)</m> and <m>Y(t) = \sin(t)</m>.
            We learned in trigonometry or calculus that the point <m>(\cos(t), \sin(t))</m> represents a point on the unit circle corresponding to a radian angle of <m>t</m>.
            Consequently, the point <m>(X(t),Y(t))</m> can be visualized as moving around the unit circle in the phase plane.
            The individual functions trace out the cosine or sine graphs in the <m>(t, X(t))</m> and <m>(t,Y(t))</m> graphs.
            But in the phase plane, <m>(X(t), Y(t))</m> traces out the circle.

            Once we recognize that two functions of time can characterize a point in the phase plane that moves, we turn our attention to the derivatives of those functions.
            Each function <m>X(t)</m> and <m>Y(t)</m> has a derivative <m>X'(t)</m> and <m>Y'(t)</m> which represent the slope of the individual graphs in the <m>(t,X)</m> and <m>(t,Y)</m> planes.
            (Remember, these are not phase planes.)
            We are going to draw a <term>vector</term> in the phase plane anchored at <m>(X(t), Y(t))</m> and ending at a point <m>(X(t) + \epsilon \cdot X'(t), Y(t) + \epsilon \cdot Y'(t))</m>, for some positive scaling value <m>\epsilon</m>.
            That second point represents a point we would reach if we followed the tangent lines for <m>X(t)</m> and <m>Y(t)</m> for some amount of time <m>\epsilon</m>.
            This resulting vector is called a <term>tangent vector</term>.
            We say that <m>(X'(t), Y'(t))</m> is the <term>velocity vector</term>, corresponding to choosing <m>\epsilon = 1</m>, and it gives the direction and speed of the tangent vector.
            These vectors will always be perfectly tangent to the curve the point follows in the phase space.

            Where a single autonomous differential equation <m>X' = f(X)</m> defines a slope field that depends only on <m>X</m> (and not <m>t</m>), an autonomous system of two differential equations

            </md>
            defines a <term>vector field</term>.
            At each point in the <m>(X,Y)</m> phase plane, the functions <m>(f_1,f_2)</m> define velocity vectors based on the location of that point.
            We then would be looking a solution that consists of two functions <m>X(t)</m> and <m>Y(t)</m> such that the resulting flow of the point <m>(X(t),Y(t))</m> through the phase plane always has its velocity vector exactly match the vector field's velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
            For practical visualization reasons, a vector field is typically rescaled so that the vectors don't overlap.
            Longer vectors correspond to faster changes in the functions.
            Shorter vectors correspond to slowly changing functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            An initial condition represents a starting point in the phase plane at some specified time.
            If we said <m>(X(t_0), Y(t_0)) = (a,b)</m>, then the point <m>(a,b)</m> is the initial point at the time <m>t = t_0</m>.
            This would require that our solution functions <m>X(t)</m> and <m>Y(t)</m> have graphs that individually pass through <m>(t_0, a)</m> and <m>(t_0,b)</m>, respectively.
