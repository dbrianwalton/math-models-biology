<title>Projection Models</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
        In the previous section, we considered a recursive formula for the new population in terms of the per capita net growth rate, <m>r(P)</m>, where the new population is computed by the difference equation 
        <me>P_{n+1} - P_n  = r(P_n) \cdot P_n,</me>
        which is equivalent to the recursive formula 
        <me>P_{n+1} = P_n + r(P_n) \cdot P_n.</me>
        The basic idea to the difference equation is that <m>r(P) \cdot P</m> is the formula for the increment of change in the population, which is why that formula is added to the previous population.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we introduce an alternative way of thinking about computing the new population. 
        In the above model, we effectively were thinking about the <em>change in the population</em> as a function of the previous population (specifically by thinking of the per capita rate as a function).
        We turn our attention now to thinking of the new population as itself being a function of the previous population.
        This function is called the <term>projection function</term>.

    <title>Projection Functions</title>
    
    <p>
        A sequence <m>x=(x_n)</m> is defined <term>recursively</term> if you have a formula to compute <m>x_{n+1}</m> in terms of the value for <m>x_n</m>.
        Generally, we have an equation that is solved for the new value in the form of 
        <me>x_{n+1} = f(x_n)</me>.
        That is, the equation has been rewritten so that the <em>new</em> value is isolated on one side of the equation and is equal to some formula involving the <em>previous</em> value of the sequence.
        We then think of the formula involving <m>x_n</m> as a <em>function</em> of <m>x_n</m>.
        That function is named the <term>projection function</term> for the sequence because it allows us to <em>project</em> (i.e., forecast) the next value of the sequence knowing the current value in the sequence.
    </p>
    
    <example>
        <p>
            The difference equation <m>P_{n+1} - P_n = r P_n</m> with an initial value defines a sequence recursively.
            This is the model for constant per capita growth rates.
            If we solve this equation for <m>P_{n+1}</m>,
            <me>P_{n+1} = P_n + r P_n</me>,
            we think of the right hand side as the projection function, <m>f(P_n) = P_n + r P_n</m>.
            In terms of a simple variable (change <m>P_n</m> to <m>x</m>), the projection function is defined by
            <me>f(x) = x+rx = (1+r)x</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We saw earlier that this sequence results in geometric sequences that grow or decay exponentially.
            If we generate this sequence <m>P = (P_0, P_1, P_2, \ldots)</m> and look at the relation <m>(P_n, P_{n+1})</m>, all of those points are on the graph of the projection function <m>y=(1+r)x</m>.
            The following code generates the sequence recursively and demonstrates this relation.

            The difference equation <m>P_{n+1} - P_n = (r_0 - a P_n) P_n</m> is the difference equation perspective for the discrete logistic model.
            Solving this equation for <m>P_{n+1}</m> gives
            <me>P_{n+1} = (1+r_0) P_n - P_n^2</me>.
            The projection function must therefore be <m>f(P_n) = (1+r_0) P_n - a P_n^2</m>.
            More simply written, the projection function for the discrete logistic model is
            <me>f(x) = (1+r_0) x - ax^2</me>.

        <p>
            Again, if we generate a sequence to follow this model, each point in the relation <m>(P_n, P_{n+1})</m> will be on the graph of the projection function <m>y=f(x)</m>.

            Not all recursive sequences have biological motivations.
            In Calculus, Newton's method is frequently taught as a way to find the positive square root of any positive number <m>a \gt 0</m>.
            The square root <m>\sqrt{a}</m> is the positive solution to <m>x^2-a=0</m>.
            Newton's method involves creating a sequence using the recursive equation
            <me>x_n^2 - a + 2x_n(x_{n+1}-x_n) = 0</me>.
            Solving this equation for <m>x_{n+1}</m>, we find the equation that writes <m>x_{n+1}</m> as a function of <m>x_n</m>,
            <me>x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n}{2} + \frac{a}{2x_n} = f(x_n)</me>.
            The projection function in this example is
            <me>f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{a}{2x}.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            The sequence generated in the code below solves for <m>\sqrt{3}</m> by using <m>a=3</m>.
            The initial value was chosen as <m>a=1</m>.
            The relation <m>(x_n, x_{n+1})</m> is graphed along with <m>y=f(x)</m>.
            The method converges very quickly, so not many distinct points appear.

        In our examples above, we started with sequences defined recursively and showed that the relation <m>(x_n, x_{n+1})</m> always matched the graph <m>y=f(x)</m> for the projection function <m>f</m>.`
        The projection function is the rule that when given the value of <m>x_n</m>, we can predict the value of <m>x_{n+1} = f(x_n)</m>.
        From a modeling perspective, we <em>find</em> projection functions by looking at the relation given by the scatter plot of <m>(x_n, x_{n+1})</m> and find an appropriate function.

                Using a computer to perform a regression to find the quadratic polynomial trend curve for these points, we find an equation <me>z_{n+1} = 0.007003 + 3.59705 z_n - 0.179759 z_n^2.</me> Most programs would have reported this as <me>y=0.007003 + 3.59705 x - 0.179759 x^2,</me> but our relation involved <m>(z_n,z_{n+1})</m> rather than the usual variables <m>(x,y)</m>. The constant term in this equation is small, and we can ask for a regression where that term is set to zero, which gives an alternative equation <me>z_{n+1} = 3.5985z_n -0.1798 z_n^2.</me></p>
            <p>The right way to do this would be to do a statistical hypothesis test on whether the constant term is significantly different from zero. However, we will keep things simple and just look at the graph and see if there appears to be a significant advantage in including the extra term. The figure below was generated to show both graphs with the data, even though it looks like only a single curve. Including the extra term has no significant impact in the model. We consider our sequence following the recursive formula <m>z_{n+1} = f(z_n)</m> using the projection function <me>f(x) = 3.5985x - 0.1798x^2.</me> In fact, the data were generated from a sequence with projection function <m>f(x)=3.6x-0.18x^2</m> with sequence values rounded to two decimal places.</p>

    <p>A population can also be in equilibrium if the sources of all growth in the population is exactly balanced by the sources of all loss. That is, the rate of birth and immigration in a population would need to be exactly balanced by the rate of death and emigration. The effect of this balance is that the sequence is constant, namely that <me>P_{n+1} = P_n.</me></p>
    
    <p>When a population is modeled by a projection function, <m>P_{n+1} = f(P_n)</m>, we can test whether an equilibrium is possible by seeing whether the equation <m>x=f(x)</m> has any solutions. That is, since <m>P_{n+1}=P_n</m> is true for an equilibrium, we are looking for all values of <m>x</m> that might be used for the sequence <m>P_n=x</m>. We call solutions to the equation <m>x=f(x)</m> the <term>fixed points</term> of the function <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
    
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>Recall that Newton's method for finding the square root <m>\sqrt{a}</m> introduced the projection function <me>f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{a}{2x}.</me> Find all of the fixed points for this function.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>We are solving the fixed point equation <m>x=f(x)</m> which becomes <me>x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{a}{2x}.</me> Solving this equation by hand corresponds to the following steps. <md>
                <mrow>x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{a}{2x}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{x}{2} = \frac{a}{2x}</mrow>
                <mrow>x^2 = a</mrow>
                <mrow>x=\pm \sqrt{a}</mrow>
            </md> So the fixed points are the positive and negative square roots of <m>a</m>.</p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>A population has a per capita net growth rate that linearly decreases with the population, <me>r(P) = 0.12 - 0.0004 P.</me> Find the projection function and identify possible equilibria for this population.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>The per capita net growth rate is related to the change in the population through births and deaths: <m>B-D = r(P) \cdot P</m>. As a difference equation, the population can be modeled as <me>P_{n+1} - P_n = r(P_n) \cdot P_n.</me> Using the given formula for <m>r(P)</m>, we can rewrite our model in recursive form as <md>
                <mrow>P_{n+1} &amp;= P_n + r(P_n) \cdot P_n</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp;= P_n + (0.12 - 0.0004 P_n) P_n</mrow>
                <mrow> &amp;= 1.12 P_n - 0.0004 P_n^2.</mrow>
            </md> A projection function corresponds to the function in the equation <m>P_{n+1}=f(P_n)</m>, which we can recognize in this problem involves <me>f(x) = 1.12x - 0.0004x^2.</me></p>
            <p>The fixed point equation <m>x=f(x)</m> allows us to find all fixed points (and therefore possible equilibria of the population). We solve the equation by factoring: <md>
            <mrow>x = 1.12x - 0.0004 x^2</mrow>
            <mrow>0 = 0.12x-0.0004x^2</mrow>
            <mrow>x(0.12 - 0.0004x) = 0</mrow>
            </md> By factoring an equation equal to zero, we find either <m>x=0</m> (a fixed point) or <m>0.12-0.0004x=0</m> (a simpler equation to find another fixed point). The other fixed point is <m>x=\frac{0.12}{0.0004} = 300</m>. So the possible equilibria for this population model are the values <m>P=0</m> or <m>P=300</m>. (Notice how we interpreted in the context of the state variable <m>P</m> rather than the fixed point variable <m>x</m>.)</p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    
    <p>A sequence that start at a fixed point will lead to a constant sequence, holding steady at the same value indefinitely. Otherwise, it is not certain what will happen. Whether a sequence converges to a fixed point depends on whether the fixed point is stable or unstable. When a fixed point is <term>stable</term>, a sequence that starts sufficiently close to the fixed point will always converge to the fixed point. Often, the sequence does not need to start very close at all to converge to a stable fixed point. However, an <term>unstable</term> fixed point results in a sequence that moves further away from the fixed point instead. We will learn methods of classifying fixed points as stable or unstable later. For now, we will just look at the values of a sequence and see if they converge or not.</p>

    <title>Computing Recursive Sequences</title>
    
    <p>In order to explore our models, we need to compute the values of the sequences we are studying. We recruit our computers to do the work for us. One approach is to use a spreadsheet. We create a table for our sequence. The first entry in our table is the initial value of the sequence. Then we use cell formulas to compute the next sequence value in the cell below the initial value. So long as the formula is the same at each step, we can then copy our formula down and additional values will be automatically generated.</p>
    
    <p>A better approach is to use a scriptable computational tool. In other words, we will program the computer to generate our sequences. One such tool is the online computational tool Sage. Sage is similar to Mathematica or Maple but is available for free. We can even embed a Sage cell directly in the online text, as shown below. The online version allows us to edit the cell to adjust the formulas to match any problem that we want.</p>
    
    <p>The default entry for the script below corresponds to Newton's method with <m>a=3</m>. Notice how quickly the sequence converges to the fixed point at <m>x^*=\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205</m>. This informs us that <m>x^*=\sqrt{3}</m> is a stable fixed point. What happens if you start close to the other fixed point at <m>x^*=-\sqrt{3} \approx -1.73205</m>?</p>

    <p>Here is the same script without any comments, just so that you can see there aren't that many steps. It is good practice to use comments to explain what your code is doing. Try modifying the script to learn how the different steps affect the overall results. <ul>
    <li>use a different projection function</li>
    <li>use a different initial value</li>
    <li>change the number of terms calculated</li>
    <li>change the number of decimal places shown</li>
    <li>change the <c>figsize</c> option on the <c>list_plot</c></li>
