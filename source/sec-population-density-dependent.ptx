    <title>Density Dependent Population Growth Models</title>
    <p>
        A population with constant per capita growth rates sees exponential growth when the birth rate <m>b</m> exceeds the death rate <m>d</m>, and exponential decay when the ordering is reversed.
        However, real population can not really grow exponentially as there iare limited resources in the environment.
        Thus, for populations that experience environmental constraints, constant per capita growth rates are not appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        We previously defined the per capita net growth rate <m>r=b-d</m> where <m>b</m> is the per capita birth rate and <m>d</m> is the per capita death rate.
        Sometimes it is inconvenient or impossible to determine the birth and death rates separately.
        If we can at least measure the net change in the population, which will be equal to <m>\Delta P_{n+1} = B_{n+1}-D_{n+1}</m>,
        then the per capita net growth rate will be a sequence defined by
        <me>r_{n+1} = \frac{\Delta P_{n+1}}{P_{n}}.</me>
        Density dependence means that the relation <m>(P_n, r_{n+1})</m> is not constant, but that <m>r_{n+1}</m> depends on <m>P_n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We turn our attention to the case that the per capita net growth rate can be modeled as a function of the population size <m>P_n</m>, where a scatter plot of the points <m>(P_n, r_{n+1})</m> could be reasonably approximated by a function.
        We generally expect that the graph will be a decreasing function because as the population gets larger, the growth rate should decrease.
        For a very large population, we expect <m>r \lt 0</m> since the population would be greater than its carrying capacity.
        Physically, however, we will always have <m>r \ge -1</m>, with <m>r=-1</m> corresponding to complete extinction.
    </p>

        <p>
            If we revisited the density-dependent agent-based model in Section <xref ref='population-agent-density-dependent'/>,
            we can plot the per capita net growth rate computed at each time step with respect to the size of the population at the beginning of the step.
            The figure below illustrates this relationship.
            Values when the population was small and demographic stochasticity is high were not included.

        <p>
            We see in the graph that the per capita net growth rate is decreasing.
            The data seem consistent with a model where the per capita rate decreases linearly.
            This makes sense because the rules of the agent-based model were that the death rate increased linearly in terms of the number of individuals on a shared patch.
        </p>

    <p>
        In order to develop an actual model, we need to find a formula that captures the relation.
        There are infinitely many different formulas that we might try to use, especially if we only have a few data points.
        To be more precise, we generally choose families of formulas that are simple and are described by only a few <term>parameters</term>.
        A <term>parameter</term> is a symbol that represents a constant that appears in the formula, like a variable that helps describe the model while not necessarily representing anything physical in the actual state of the system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The simplest density dependent model to write down would be when <m>r</m> is a linear function of <m>P</m>, 
        <me>r(P) = r_0 - a P.</me>
        The values <m>r_0</m> and <m>a</m> are the <term>parameters</term> of the model.
        Here <m>r_0</m> is called the <term>intrinsic per capita net growth rate</term> and represents the per capita net growth rate when <m>P \approx 0</m>.
        For a small population, far from the carrying capacity, this represents the value of <m>r</m> that looks like an exponential growth model until the population size starts to cause density dependent effects.
        The parameter <m>a</m> is the size of the slope indicating how much the growth rate <m>r</m> decreases per individual.
    </p>

            Using the density dependent data from our agent-based model, we can use linear regression to find a line of best fit. This gives us the following values for the parameters: 
            <md>
                <mrow> r_0 = 6.616 \times 10^{-2}, </mrow>
                <mrow> a = 6.275 \times 10^{-6}. </mrow>
            </md>
            The resulting parametric model for the per capita growth rate is then given by
            <me>r(P) = 6.616 \times 10^{-2} - 6.275 \times 10^{-6} \, P.</me>
            A graph showing the trend line with the data is given below.
