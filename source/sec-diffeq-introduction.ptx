<title>Introduction to Differential Equations</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
        Sequences give us a way to model values at specific evenly spaced times.
        However, they do not provide a method to model values between those times.
        Furthermore, discrete time projeciton models are based on using the values of the state variables at one instant in time to predict a future value one time interval later.
        That is, the increment of change is considered to be a single bulk change in values.
    </p>
    <p>
        We often want to consider models that allow us to predict values for a state at <em>any</em> time.
        We want to have the model describe how the state is changing continuously throughout time, rather than one bulk increment of change.
        The most basic mathematical tool to model continuous functions is a <term>differential equation</term>.

    <title>Rates of Change</title>

    <p>
        In order to motivate differential equations, let us think back to population models where the population changed according to births and deaths.
        For discrete time models, we established functions that described <em>how many</em> births or deaths to add over the course of a cycle.
        Such a function represented the total accumulated births or deaths, regardless of exactly when those events occurred.
        For a continuous time model, we instead think in terms of the rate at which births and deaths are occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <term>rate of change</term> represents the ratio between the changes of two covarying variables.
        One of the simplest examples is velocity which is the rate of change of distance traveled with respect to time, for which you probably have heard the saying, <dq>distance equals rate times time.</dq>
        Mathematically, this is saying that the distance traveled is <em>proportional</em> to the time spent travelling and the rate (velocity) is the proportionality constant.
        However, this is technically only true for constant rates of change.
        Calculus introduced the <term>derivative</term> as the mathematical quantity that measures the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term>.
        This rate of change results from the idea of computing the limit of an average rate of change.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider a quantity <m>Q</m> that is a function of time <m>t</m>.
        The instantaneous rate of change of <m>Q</m> with respect to <m>t</m> at a particular moment <m>t=a</m> is defined as the derivative
        <me> \left. \frac{dQ}{dt} \right|_a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{Q(a+\Delta t) - Q(a)}{\Delta t}</me>.
        Thinking of this in reverse, this is telling us that the value <m>Q(a + \Delta t)</m> can approximately be found as
        <me> Q(a + \Delta t) \approx Q(a) + \left.\frac{dQ}{dt}\right|_a \cdot \Delta t</me>.
        That is, the increment of change in <m>Q</m> is approximately just the derivative times the increment of time.
        The approximation improves as the increment of time decreases and is exact in the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Returning to our ideas of births and deaths, this suggests that instead of thinking of the total number of births and deaths in a given time period (e.g., per year), we will think of a <em>rate</em> of births or deaths <em>per unit time</em> so that in a <em>short</em> interval of time, the <em>number</em> of births or deaths is approximately that corresponding rate times the length of the time interval.

        <title>Differential Equations</title>
        
        <p>
            A differential equation is an equation that defines the rate of change (a derivative) for a quantity.
            Unlike calculus where we would start with a function's formula and use rules of calculus to find the derivative's formula, in modeling we are going to think of the rate of change as a state variable that can be part of an equation.
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    We know that a population that is not constrained by its environment tends to grow exponentially.
                    That is, we can think of the population as a function of time <m>P(t)</m> as satisfying an exponential model,
                    <me>P(t) = Ae^{rt}</me>,
                    where <m>A</m> and <m>r</m> are appropriate constants.
                    The rate of change with respect to time can be calculated using calculus rules to find
                    <me>P'(t) = Are^{rt}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can identify a relation between the state variables of <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> by calculating the ratio <m>P' / P</m> and simplifying.
                    Since <m>P'</m> is the overall rate of change and <m>P</m> is the population, the ratio refers to the <term>per capita rate of change</term>.
                    Using the exponential formula and its derivative, we discover that an exponentially growing (or decaying) population satisfies the equation
                    <me>\frac{P'}{P} = \frac{Are^{rt}}{Ae^{rt}} = r</me>.
                    Exponential growth exactly corresponds to having a constant per capita rate of change.
                    That is, we have a differential equation
                    <me>P' = r P</me>
                    that corresponds to a population model <m>P(t) = Ae^{rt}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </example>

        <p>
            Notice in the previous example that when we started with the differential equation
            <me>P' = r P</me>
            the formula for solutions had the form
            <me>P(t) = Ae^{rt}</me>.
            The value of <m>r</m> is part of the differential equation.
            But the value of <m>A</m> is unspecified, meaning it is free to choose.
            We are allowed to solve for a specific value for <m>A</m> in order to match an initial condition.
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find a solution to the differential equation
                    <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = 3 P</me>
                    that has initial value <m>P(0) = 5</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Time-dependent variables (functions of time) whose derivatives are proportional to the value of the variable must be exponential.
                    Our example has proportionality constant <m>r=3</m>, so the solutions have the form
                    <me>P(t) = Ae^{3t}</me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the value of <m>A</m>, we use the model formula with <m>t=0</m> and use it to match the given information <m>P(0) = 5</m>.
                    From our formula, we have
                    <me>P(0) = Ae^{3 \cdot 0} = Ae^0 = A</me>.
                    Because we know <m>P(0) = A</m> (from the model formula) and <m>P(0) = 5</m> (from the initial condition), we must have <m>A = 5</m>.
                    That is, <m>P(t) = 5e^{3t}</m> satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            Mathematics courses focusing on solving differential equations introduce strategies for finding formulas for solutions to differential equations.
            Because many applications of differential equations don't actually have formula solutions, we will focus on numerical solutions.

    <subsection xml:id='subsec-diffeq-numerical-solutions'>
        <title>Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
        <p>
            A general differential equation for a single time-dependent state variable <m>Q</m> will take the form
            <me>Q'(t) = F(t, Q(t))</me>.
            The function <m>F</m> is not the derivative itself.
            Rather, the differential equation says that the value of the rate of change, <m>Q'(t)</m>, will exactly match some formula involving <m>t</m> and <m>Q(t)</m>.
            The following theorem guarantees that a differential equation with an initial value has a unique solution under reasonable conditions.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id='thm-diffeq-existence-uniqueness'>
            <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Initial Value Problems</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>F(t,y)</m> represents a continuous function of both <m>t</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}</m> exists and is bounded (i.e., small changes in <m>y</m> should result in small changes in <m>F(t,y)</m>. Then the differential equation <me>\frac{dQ}{dt} = F(t,Q)</me> with initial value <m>Q(a) = b</m> has a unique solution for some interval <m>t \in (a-\epsilon, a+\epsilon)</m> with <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    The proof is outside the scope of this text but is based on the convergence of approximations.
                </p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            An existence property guarantees that a solution will exist on some small interval near the initial value.
            This gives us a justification for trying to find what that solution looks like.
            When we look for solutions, we do need to be mindful that we might try to use an interval that is larger than the solution can actually use.
            So if our method fails, we might need to try a smaller interval of time.
            The uniqueness property indicates that for any initial value, there can only be one solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            In R, we can use the <c>deSolve</c> library to find numerical solutions.
            This library defines a function <c>ode</c> (stands for <em>ordinary differential equation</em>) that creates the these approximations.
            To solve our equation, we will need to define a function that calculates the function on the right-hand side of the equation.
            We also need to provide the initial condition and an array of times where we will evaluate the solution.
        </p>
        
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find a numerical approximation for the solution of the differential equation <me>\frac{dQ}{dt} = 3Q</me> with the intial value <m>Q(0) = 5</m> and compare it to the exact solution we found earlier <m>Q(t) = 5e^{3t}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Our R script will need to first call <c>library(deSolve)</c>.
                    Then we will define our rate function to represent the formula <m>3Q</m>.
                    This function is required to have three input arguments<mdash/>time, the state, and parameters for the model.
                    The state will eventually include all of our state variables, but for now will only consist of the single variable <m>Q</m>.
                    Our model does not have any additional parameters, so the parameters will not actually be used in this example.
                    Once the differential equation is defined, we provide the initial value and times we wish to evaluate.
