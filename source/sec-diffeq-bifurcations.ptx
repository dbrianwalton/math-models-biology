    <title>Bifurcations and the Impacts of Intervention</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            One important reason for using mathematical models is to be able to predict the consequences of proposed interventions.
            We have already developed the ideas of creating differential equation models for individual populations as well as multiple interacting systems.
            Given those models, we know how to find equilibrium solutions and to determine whether those equilibria are stable or unstable.
            Interventions will obviously result in changes to future values and dynamics for the state variables.
            They also might fundamentally change the structure of the system, introducing or removing equilibrium solutions or changing the stability of those equilibria.
            These structural changes to the behavior are called <term>bifurcations</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section, we will learn about strategies for exploring possible bifurcations.
            For two-dimensional systems with only two state variables, we will find there are some algebraic approaches for this exploration involving the quadratic formula.
            For more complicated systems or where the algebra becomes too complex, we will be able to explore possible bifurcations numerically.

        <title>Predation and Harvesting</title>
        <p>
            The original mathematical model for a predator-prey interaction introduced in <xref ref="subsec-diffeq-predator-prey"/> was developed by Vito Volterra, an Italian mathematician.
            Volterra had been approached by Umberto D'Ancona, his future son-in-law, to help understand some surprising data regarding fishing yields in the Mediterranean when comparing the years during World War 1 with the years when the war was not occurring.
            During the war, there was less fishing but records showed a higher percentage of the catch were sharks and rays.
            D'Ancona wanted to understand why this would happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can consider the predator-prey model as a natural system of the interactions between food fish and predator fish<mdash/>the sharks and rays.
            Let <m>F</m> be the size of the fish population and let <m>S</m> be the size of the shark and ray population.
            Fishing with nets introduces an additional rate of loss since all kinds of fish are caught.
            We can see this explicitly by introducing harvesting rates for both populations that are proportional to the population sizes.
            The populations will then be modeled by the system of differential equations
            <md>
                <mrow>F' \amp = r_F F - b F S - \lambda F, </mrow>
                <mrow>S' \amp = -r_S S + c F S - \mu S. </mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            The equilibrium values move if the parameters for the fishing rate parameters <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m> change.
            The <m>F</m> nullcline has two parts, <m>F=0</m> and <m>r_F - bS - \lambda = 0</m> which gives <m>S = \frac{r_F - \lambda}{b}</m>.
            Similarly, the <m>S</m> nullcline has two parts <m>S=0</m> and <m>-r_S + cF - \mu = 0</m>, which gives <m>F = \frac{r_S + \mu}{c}</m>.
            The equilibrium at <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m> does not depend on any parameters.
            The other equilibrium at <m>(F,S) = (\frac{r_S + \mu}{c}, \frac{r_F - \lambda}{b})</m> does depend on the parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that if the amount of fishing increases, the fish population at equilibrium goes <em>up</em> and the predator population of sharks and rays goes <em>down</em>.
            But during the war, fishing effort went down, resulting in a counterintuitive <em>reduction</em> in the food fish population and an <em>increase</em> in the predator population.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps even more surprisingly, suppose that we could be specific in how we fish and <em>only</em> catch food fish.
            This would correspond to <m>\mu = 0</m>, with no harvesting of sharks and rays.
            In this case, the equilibrium value for the food fish does not depend at all on the amount fishing taking place.
            Instead, it is the predator population that sees the impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discussion above focused on the <em>value</em> of the equilibrium solutions.
            Changing the fishing harvesting coefficient resulted in a change of the <em>location</em> of the equilibrium.
            This in itself is not a bifurcation, but will be related to that concept.
            To see a bifurcation, we need to also look at stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the equilibrium solution at <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m>.
            The Jacobian matrix made from the partial derivatives will help us determine the stability.
            The rate function for <m>F</m> is given by
            <me>
                F' = f_1(F,S) = r_F F - b F S - \lambda F,
            </me>
            which has partial derivatives
            <md>
                <mrow>\partial_F f_1 \amp = r_f - bS - \lambda,</mrow>
                <mrow> \partial_S f_1 \amp = - b F.</mrow>
            </md>
            The rate function for <m>S</m> is given by
            <me>
                S' = f_2(F,S) = -r_S S + c F S - \mu S,
            </me>
            which has partial derivatives
            <md>
                <mrow>\partial_F f_2 \amp = c S,</mrow>
                <mrow> \partial_S f_2 \amp = -r_S + c F - \mu.</mrow>
            </md>
            When the Jacobian is evaluated at the equilibrium <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m>,
            we get the matrix
            <me>
                Df(0,0) = \begin{bmatrix}
                r_F - \lambda \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -r_S - \mu
                \end{bmatrix}
            </me>            
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jacobian matrix gives the coefficients for the linear approximation that controls the distance between solutions and the equilibrium solutions, <m>\epsilon_F</m> and <m>\epsilon_S</m>,
            <md>
                <mrow> \epsilon_F' \amp = r_F \epsilon_F </mrow>
                <mrow> \epsilon_S' \amp = -(r_S + \mu) \epsilon_S </mrow>
            </md>
            Because the values <m>r_F, r_S, \mu</m> are all constant, these are just the differential equations for exponential functions,
            <md>
                <mrow> \epsilon_F(t) \amp = \epsilon_{F,0} e^{(r_F-\lambda) t}, </mrow>
                <mrow> \epsilon_S(t) \amp = \epsilon_{S,0} e^{ -(r_S + \mu)t}.</mrow>
            </md>
            The distance <m>\epsilon_S</m> between <m>S(t)</m> and the corresponding equilibrium value <m>S=0</m> follows exponential decay regardless of the parameter values.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the distance <m>\epsilon_F</m> between <m>F(t)</m> and its equilibrium value <m>F=0</m> can be either exponential growth or decay, depending on which parameter is larger.
            When <m>\lambda \lt r_F</m>, the distance <m>\epsilon_F</m> <em>grows</em> exponentially and the equilibrium is <em>unstable</em>.
            However, if <m>\lambda \gt r_F</m>, the distance will <em>decay</em> exponentially and now the equilibrium has both directions seeing decaying distances.
            The stability of <m>(F,S)=(0,0)</m> changes stability at <m>\lambda = r_F</m>.
            We say there is a <term>bifurcation</term> at <m>\lambda = r_F</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see this bifurcation in the interactive <xref ref="fig-predator-prey-bifurcation-dynamics"/>.
            The parameters correspond to a nondimensionalized version of the model so that the equilibrium with no fishing intensity is at <m>(F,S)=(1,1)</m>.
            Nullclines are also shown in the phase plane.
            Notice that the bifurcation occurs when the <m>F</m> nullcline crosses <m>S=0</m>.

        <title>Analysis for Two-Dimensional Systems</title>
        <p>
            Mathematical analysis of stability is based on eigenvalues of the linearized system using the Jacobian matrix.
            We have been restricted to analysis after we assign specific numerical values to the parameters.
            Analysis using the parameters as symbols requires a more detailed understanding of linear algebra, specifically how to compute eigenvalues algebraically.
        </p>
        <p>
            In linear algebra, we learn that eigenvalues are the roots of a polynomial equation where the degree of the polynomial matches the dimension of the matrix.
            For two-dimensional systems, those which only have two state variables, the analysis reduces to solving a quadratic equation.
            Because this is accessible to us, we will introduce this approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roots of a polynomial directly correspond to factors of the polynomial.
            For a quadratic, there will be two roots.
            As we typicaly represent eigenvalues with the Greek letter <m>\lambda</m>, our two eigenvalues will be stated as <m>\lambda = \lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda = \lambda_2</m>.
            The quadratic equation that we solve would therefore need to be, in factored form, equivalent to
            <me>(\lambda - \lambda_1)(\lambda - \lambda_2) = 0</me>.
            Expanding this formula out using distribution, the equation will be equivalent to
            <me>\lambda^2 - (\lambda_1 + \lambda 2) \lambda + \lambda_1 \lambda_2 = 0</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We now use two more facts from linear algebra, again stated without justification here.
            For any matrix, the sum of diagonal entries, which is called the <term>trace</term> of the matrix, is always equal to the <em>sum</em> of the eigenvalues.
            For the two-dimensional matrix <m>A</m>, the trace is calculated by
            <me>\tr(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = a + d.</me>
            In addition, the <term>determinant</term> of a square matrix is always equal to the <em>product</em> of the eigenvalues.
            For the matrix <m>A</m> above, the determinant is calculated by
            <me>\det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda 2 = ad - bc.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Consequently, given <em>any</em> two-dimensional square matrix <m>A</m>, if we calculate the trace <m>p = \tr(A)</m> and the determinant <m>q = \det(A)</m>, then we will find the eigenvalues by solving the quadratic equation
            <me>\lambda^2 - p \lambda + q = 0</me>.
            We can always do this using the quadratic formula to obtain
            <me>\lambda = \frac{p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}}{2}</me>.
            We can now make some quick conclusions about the eigenvalues.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm-2x2-matrix-eigenvalues">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Given a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m> with <m>\tr(A) = p</m> and <m>\det(A) = q</m>, we have the following:

                            If <m>q = \det(A) \lt 0</m> (negative determinant), then there are two real eigenvalues, one of which is positive and one of which is negative.

                            If <m>q = \det(A) = 0</m> (zero determinant), then the eigenvalues are <m>\lambda = p</m> and <m>\lambda=0</m>.

                            Furthermore, there are three possibilities

                                    If <m>p^2 = 4q</m>, then the eigenvalues have the same real value (double root).

        <p>
            The inequalities in <xref ref="thm-2x2-matrix-eigenvalues"/> can be used with a symbolic Jacobian matrix for a two-dimensional system to explore bifurcations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the nondimensionalized producer-consumer model where we introduce harvesting of the producer,
            <md>
                <mrow>\dot{a} \amp = a(1-a-z) - \mu a </mrow>
                <mrow>\dot{z} \amp = (-\rho + \beta a) \cdot z. </mrow>
            </md>
            There are three possible equilibria solutions:
            <ol>
                <li><p> <m>(a,z) = (0,0)</m>, </p></li>
                <li><p> <m>(a,z) = (1-\mu,0)</m>, </p></li>
                <li><p> <m>(a,z) = (\frac{\rho}{\beta}, 1-\mu-\frac{\rho}{\beta})</m>. </p></li>
            </ol>
            The Jacobian matrix made from partial derivatives based on the ordering <m>(a,z)</m> is given by
            <me>
                Df = \begin{bmatrix}
                1 - \mu - 2a - z \amp -a \\
                \beta z \amp -\rho + \beta a
                \end{bmatrix}.
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us first consider the stability of mutual extinction at <m>(a,z) = (0,0)</m>.
            The Jacobian matrix evaluated at this equilibrium point is 
            <me>
                Df = \begin{bmatrix}
                1 - \mu \amp 0 \\
                0 \amp -\rho 
                \end{bmatrix}.
            </me>
            The <em>trace</em> of the matrix is given by <m>\tr(Df) = 1 - \mu - \rho</m> and the <em>determinant</em> is given by <m>\det(Df) = (1-\mu) \cdot -\rho = \rho(\mu - 1)</m>.
            We know <m>\rho \gt 0</m> is positive.
            If <m>\mu \lt 1</m>, then we have <m>\det(Df) \lt 0</m>.
            By <xref ref="thm-2x2-matrix-eigenvalues"/>, this means there will be one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue.
            The positive eigenvalues implies that the equilibrium <m>(a,z) = (0,0)</m> is <em>unstable</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we increase <m>\mu \gt 1</m>, then we now have a positive determinant as well as a negative trace, <m>\tr(Df) = 1-\mu-\rho \lt 0</m>.
            By <xref ref="thm-2x2-matrix-eigenvalues"/>, this means the real part of both eigenvalues must be negative which, in turn, implies that the equilibrium <m>(a,z) = (0,0)</m> becomes <em>stable</em>.
            That is, too much harvesting of the producer will cause extinction of both producer and consumre to be stable.
            The bifurcation makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us next consider the stability of the equilibrium at <m>(a,z) = (1-\mu, 0)</m>, where only the producer is present.
            The Jacobian matrix evaluated at this second equilibrium point is 
            <me>
                Df = \begin{bmatrix}
                -1 + \mu \amp -1 + \mu \\
                0 \amp -\rho  + \beta (1-\mu)
                \end{bmatrix}.
            </me>
            The trace of the Jacobian is <m>\tr(Df) = (-1+\mu) + (-\rho+\beta(1-\mu))</m> and the determinant is <m>\det(Df) = (-1+\mu) \cdot (-\rho+\beta(1-\mu))</m>.
            Notice how the trace and determinant are <em>already</em> written as the sum and product of values as written, so those terms must be the eigenvalues,
            <md>
                <mrow>\lambda_1 \amp = -1 + \mu </mrow>
                <mrow>\lambda_2 \amp = -\rho + \beta(1-\mu) </mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing the eigenvalues, we can think now about stability.
            We first look at the case with no harvesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            When there is no harvesting, <m>\mu = 0</m>, we have <m>\lambda_1 = -1</m>, which is negative, and <m>\lambda_2 = -\rho + \beta</m>, which could be positive or negative, depending on the relation between <m>\rho</m> and <m>\beta</m>.
            If <m>\rho \gt \beta</m> then <m>\lambda_2</m> will be negative and the equilibrium will be <em>stable</em>.
            This physically is because we are saying that the consumers are dying at a faster rate than they can grow in the presence of the producers at their carrying capacity.
            So only producers are capable of surviving.
            On the other hand, if <m>\rho \lt \beta</m>, the consumers in the presence of at-capacity producers are able to grow faster than they die corresponding to a <em>positive</em> eigenvalue, making the equilibrium <em>unstable</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens as we increase the harvesting rate <m>\mu</m>?
            As long as <m>\mu \lt 1</m>, the producers are able to reproduce faster than harvesting is able to remove them, resulting in the first eigenvalue being a negative value <m>\lambda_1 = -1 + \mu</m>.
            This corresponds to the tendency of producers to be driven towards their carrying capacity which was shifted due to harvesting.
            For the second eigenavalue, if we originally had <m>\rho \gt \beta</m>, then with <m>\mu \gt 0</m> we have <m>\lambda_2 = -\rho + \beta(1-\mu)</m> will also necessarily be negative, and the equilibrium is stable.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, if we originally had <m>\rho \lt \beta</m> so that the equilibrium was unstable for <m>\mu=0</m>, then there will be a bifurcation at <m>\mu = 1 - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>.
            for <m>0 \le \mu \lt 1 - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>, we will have <m>\lambda_2 \gt 0</m> and an unstable equilibrium.
            For <m>\mu \gt 1 - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>, we have <m>\lambda_2 \lt 0</m>.
            In this range, both eigenvalues are negative and the equilibrium is <em>stable</em>.
            The level of harvesting of the producers pushes levels of the producer population below what the consumers require to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if we cause <m>\mu \gt 1</m>, two things happen.
            First, the location of the equilibrium <m>(a, z) = (1-\mu,0)</m> has a negative value for <m>a</m>, which is unbiological.
            Furthermore, the corresponding eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1 = -1+ \mu</m> is now positive, causing that mathematical equilibrium to be unstable.
         </p>
         <p>
            Finally, notice that the third equilibrium corresponding to both algae and zooplankton coexisting occurs with <m>z = 1 - \mu - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>.
            If <m>\mu \gt 1 - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>, which was required for the algae-only equilibrium to be stable, the coexisting equilibrium has a nonbiological value <m>z \lt 0</m>.
            But when <m>\mu \lt 1 - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m>, the coexisting equilibrium is biological and the algae-only equilibrium is unstable.
            But is the coexisting equilibrium stable?
         </p>
         <p>
            At the coexisting equilibrium at <m>(a,z) = (\frac{\rho}{\beta}, 1-\mu-\frac{\rho}{\beta})</m>, assuming <m>\rho \lt \beta</m>,
            the Jacobian matrix is
            <me>
                Df = \begin{bmatrix}
                -\frac{\rho}{\beta} \amp -\frac{\rho}{\beta} \\
                \beta \cdot (1 - \mu - \frac{\rho}{beta}) \amp 0
                \end{bmatrix}.
            </me>
            We find <m>\tr(Df) = - \frac{\rho}{\beta}</m> and <m>\det(Df) = \rho \cdot (1 - \mu - \frac{\rho}{\beta})</m>.
