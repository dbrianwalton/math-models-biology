    <title>Bifurcations and the Impacts of Intervention</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            One important reason for using mathematical models is to be able to predict the consequences of proposed interventions.
            We have already developed the ideas of creating differential equation models for individual populations as well as multiple interacting systems.
            Given those models, we know how to find equilibrium solutions and to determine whether those equilibria are stable or unstable.
            Interventions will obviously result in changes to future values and dynamics for the state variables.
            They also might fundamentally change the structure of the system, introducing or removing equilibrium solutions or changing the stability of those equilibria.
            These structural changes to the behavior are called <term>bifurcations</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section, we will learn about strategies for exploring possible bifurcations.
            For two-dimensional systems with only two state variables, we will find there are some algebraic approaches for this exploration involving the quadratic formula.
            For more complicated systems or where the algebra becomes too complex, we will be able to explore possible bifurcations numerically.

        <title>Predation and Harvesting</title>
        <p>
            The original mathematical model for a predator-prey interaction introduced in <xref ref="subsec-diffeq-predator-prey"/> was developed by Vito Volterra, an Italian mathematician.
            Volterra had been approached by Umberto D'Ancona, his future son-in-law, to help understand some surprising data regarding fishing yields in the Mediterranean when comparing the years during World War 1 with the years when the war was not occurring.
            During the war, there was less fishing but records showed a higher percentage of the catch were sharks and rays.
            D'Ancona wanted to understand why this would happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can consider the predator-prey model as a natural system of the interactions between food fish and predator fish<mdash/>the sharks and rays.
            Let <m>F</m> be the size of the fish population and let <m>S</m> be the size of the shark and ray population.
            Fishing with nets introduces an additional rate of loss since all kinds of fish are caught.
            We can see this explicitly by introducing harvesting rates for both populations that are proportional to the population sizes.
            The populations will then be modeled by the system of differential equations
            <md>
                <mrow>F' \amp = r_F F - b F S - \lambda F, </mrow>
                <mrow>S' \amp = -r_S S + c F S - \mu S. </mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            The equilibrium values move if the parameters for the fishing rate parameters <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m> change.
            The <m>F</m> nullcline has two parts, <m>F=0</m> and <m>r_F - bS - \lambda = 0</m> which gives <m>S = \frac{r_F - \lambda}{b}</m>.
            Similarly, the <m>S</m> nullcline has two parts <m>S=0</m> and <m>-r_S + cF - \mu = 0</m>, which gives <m>F = \frac{r_S + \mu}{c}</m>.
            The equilibrium at <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m> does not depend on any parameters.
            The other equilibrium at <m>(F,S) = (\frac{r_S + \mu}{c}, \frac{r_F - \lambda}{b})</m> does depend on the parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that if the amount of fishing increases, the fish population at equilibrium goes <em>up</em> and the predator population of sharks and rays goes <em>down</em>.
            But during the war, fishing effort went down, resulting in a counterintuitive <em>reduction</em> in the food fish population and an <em>increase</em> in the predator population.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps even more surprisingly, suppose that we could be specific in how we fish and <em>only</em> catch food fish.
            This would correspond to <m>\mu = 0</m>, with no harvesting of sharks and rays.
            In this case, the equilibrium value for the food fish does not depend at all on the amount fishing taking place.
            Instead, it is the predator population that sees the impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discussion above focused on the <em>value</em> of the equilibrium solutions.
            Changing the fishing harvesting coefficient resulted in a change of the <em>location</em> of the equilibrium.
            This in itself is not a bifurcation, but will be related to that concept.
            To see a bifurcation, we need to also look at stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the equilibrium solution at <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m>.
            The Jacobian matrix made from the partial derivatives will help us determine the stability.
            The rate function for <m>F</m> is given by
            <me>
                F' = f_1(F,S) = r_F F - b F S - \lambda F,
            </me>
            which has partial derivatives
            <md>
                <mrow>\partial_F f_1 \amp = r_f - bS - \lambda,</mrow>
                <mrow> \partial_S f_1 \amp = - b F.</mrow>
            </md>
            The rate function for <m>S</m> is given by
            <me>
                S' = f_2(F,S) = -r_S S + c F S - \mu S,
            </me>
            which has partial derivatives
            <md>
                <mrow>\partial_F f_2 \amp = c S,</mrow>
                <mrow> \partial_S f_2 \amp = -r_S + c F - \mu.</mrow>
            </md>
            When the Jacobian is evaluated at the equilibrium <m>(F,S) = (0,0)</m>,
            we get the matrix
            <me>
                Df(0,0) = \begin{bmatrix}
                r_F - \lambda \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -r_S - \mu
                \end{bmatrix}
            </me>            
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jacobian matrix gives the coefficients for the linear approximation that controls the distance between solutions and the equilibrium solutions, <m>\epsilon_F</m> and <m>\epsilon_S</m>,
            <md>
                <mrow> \epsilon_F' \amp = r_F \epsilon_F </mrow>
                <mrow> \epsilon_S' \amp = -(r_S + \mu) \epsilon_S </mrow>
            </md>
            Because the values <m>r_F, r_S, \mu</m> are all constant, these are just the differential equations for exponential functions,
            <md>
                <mrow> \epsilon_F(t) \amp = \epsilon_{F,0} e^{(r_F-\lambda) t}, </mrow>
                <mrow> \epsilon_S(t) \amp = \epsilon_{S,0} e^{ -(r_S + \mu)t}.</mrow>
            </md>
            The distance <m>\epsilon_S</m> between <m>S(t)</m> and the corresponding equilibrium value <m>S=0</m> follows exponential decay regardless of the parameter values.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the distance <m>\epsilon_F</m> between <m>F(t)</m> and its equilibrium value <m>F=0</m> can be either exponential growth or decay, depending on which parameter is larger.
            When <m>\lambda \lt r_F</m>, the distance <m>\epsilon_F</m> <em>grows</em> exponentially and the equilibrium is <em>unstable</em>.
            However, if <m>\lambda \gt r_F</m>, the distance will <em>decay</em> exponentially and now the equilibrium has both directions seeing decaying distances.
            The stability of <m>(F,S)=(0,0)</m> changes stability at <m>\lambda = r_F</m>.
            We say there is a <term>bifurcation</term> at <m>\lambda = r_F</m>.
