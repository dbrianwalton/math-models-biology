<div class="para">When you evaluate that work, we will match results we would get using basic calculus. If <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = (1+r_0)x - ax^2\text{,}\)</span> we know how to find a derivative as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = (1+r_0) - 2 a x\text{.}

</div>
<div class="para">Similarly, we can algebraically write down the fixed point equation and solve it by hand:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f(x) \amp = x \\
(1+r_0)x - a x^2 \amp = x \\
x+r_0 x - a x^2 \amp = x \\
r_0 x - a x^2 \amp = 0\\
x(r_0 - a x) \amp = 0

</div>
<div class="para">Because this equation says the product of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(r_0 - ax\)</span> equals zero, the solutions are found by setting each factor individually to zero, giving us <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = \frac{r_0}{a}\)</span> as our two solutions. This matches what Sage tells us.</div>

<div class="para">From our Sage work, or by evaluating <span class="process-math">\(f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> we find <span class="process-math">\(f'(0) = 1+r_0\text{.}\)</span> This means that whenever <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(0) \gt 1\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="projection-analysis.html#thm-projection-fixed-point-stability" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/thm-projection-fixed-point-stability.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 2.5.8: Stability of Fixed Points for Projection Functions">TheoremÂ 2.5.8</a>, we now know that <span class="process-math">\(x^* = 0\)</span> is an unstable fixed point whenever <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \gt 0\)</span> It is actually possible to have <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt r_0 \lt 0\)</span> if the per capita death rate exceeds the per capita birth rate. In that circumstance, we have <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt f'(0) \lt 1\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, <span class="process-math">\(x^*=0\)</span> is a stable fixed when the death rate exceeds the birth rate for <span class="process-math">\(P=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">For the second fixed point <span class="process-math">\(x^* = \frac{r_0}{a}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x^*) = 1 - r_0\text{.}\)</span> We think through the same conditions as above. If <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt r_0 \lt 0\)</span> (negative <span class="process-math">\(r_0\)</span>), we have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x^*) \gt 1\)</span> but we also have a fixed point <span class="process-math">\(x^* \lt 0\)</span> with a negative value. In the current setting for populations, <span class="process-math">\(P\lt 0\)</span> does not make sense. But mathematically, such a negative fixed point would be unstable. If <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt r_0 \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> between 0 and 1, which means the fixed point is locally stable and sequences converge without oscillation. Once we have <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f'(x*) \lt 0\)</span> so that nearby sequences oscillate above and then below the fixed point. For <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt r_0 \lt 2\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(|f'(x^*)| \lt 1\)</span> and the oscillation decays away to the stable fixed point. Once we have <span class="process-math">\(r_0 \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> this causes <span class="process-math">\(|f'(x^*)| \gt 1\)</span> such that oscillation grows and the fixed point is locally unstable.</div>
